# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

## Required Homework/Tasks ##
### Install and Verify AWS CLI

I successfully installed Gitpod but decided to go with local alternative - Visual Studio Code and Git on my PC - Windows 11

I followed the documentation provided by AWS link --> [AWS CLI Installation on WIndows](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)

Downloaded the installer - msi and executed it.

After the installation I configured it using my IAM user's credentials in order to be able to establish connection with AWS.

### Create a Billing Alarm

I created a bidget with $20 limit. This is the maximum amount that I can afford to spend if something goes wrong ðŸ¤ž
Hope this one is enough.
