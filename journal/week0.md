### Install and Verify AWS CLI

I successfully installed Gitpod but decided to go with local alternative - Visual Studio Code and Git on my PC - Windows 11

I followed the documentation provided by AWS here- <a AWS CLI Installation on WIndows="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html"></a>.

Downloaded the installer - msi and executed it.

After the installation I configured it using my IAM user's credentials in order to be able to establish connection with AWS.
